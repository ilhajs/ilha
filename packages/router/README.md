# `@ilha/router`

A lightweight, isomorphic router for [Ilha](https://github.com/ilhajs/ilha) islands. Runs in the browser with full reactivity and on the server as a synchronous HTML string renderer. Pairs natively with the file-system routing Vite plugin for zero-config page management.

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install @ilha/router
# or Bun
bun add @ilha/router
```

---

## Quick Start

### Client-side

```ts
import { router } from "@ilha/router";
import { homePage, aboutPage, userPage, notFound } from "./pages";

router()
  .route("/", homePage)
  .route("/about", aboutPage)
  .route("/user/:id", userPage)
  .route("/**", notFound)
  .mount("#app");
```

### Server-side (SSR)

```ts
import { router } from "@ilha/router";
import { homePage, aboutPage, userPage, notFound } from "./pages";

export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  const html = router()
    .route("/", homePage)
    .route("/about", aboutPage)
    .route("/user/:id", userPage)
    .route("/**", notFound)
    .render(event.node.req.url ?? "/");

  return new Response(`<!doctype html><html><body>${html}</body></html>`, {
    headers: { "content-type": "text/html" },
  });
});
```

### SSR + Client Hydration (recommended)

```ts
// routes/[...].ts — Nitro handler
import { pageRouter } from "ilha:pages";
import { registry } from "ilha:registry";

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const html = await pageRouter.renderHydratable(event.node.req.url ?? "/", registry);
  return new Response(`<!doctype html><html><body>${html}</body></html>`, {
    headers: { "content-type": "text/html" },
  });
});
```

```ts
// src/client.ts — browser entry
import { pageRouter } from "ilha:pages";
import { registry } from "ilha:registry";

pageRouter.hydrate(registry);
```

---

## Hash mode

By default, the router uses the HTML5 History API and treats `location.pathname` as the route. This requires either a server that serves the SPA shell at every URL, or a static host with a SPA fallback. When neither is available — the document is loaded over `file://`, embedded in a desktop wrapper like Electron or Electrobun, opened directly from disk, or served from a host that can't be configured for SPA fallbacks — switch to **hash mode**, which stores the route in `location.hash`:

```ts
import { setHistoryMode, router } from "@ilha/router";

setHistoryMode("hash"); // ← call once, before mounting

router().route("/", homePage).route("/about", aboutPage).route("/user/:id", userPage).mount("#app");
```

`setHistoryMode("hash")` must be called **before** `.mount()`, `.hydrate()`, or `prime()`. Once set, every navigation API in this package — `navigate()`, `RouterLink`, `enableLinkInterception()`, popstate handling — operates against `location.hash` instead of `location.pathname`.

URLs in hash mode look like:

```
file:///path/to/index.html#/
file:///path/to/index.html#/about
file:///path/to/index.html#/user/42?tab=overview
file:///path/to/index.html#/docs/intro#section
```

The portion after the `#` is parsed as if it were a real URL — the path comes first, followed by an optional query string and an optional in-page anchor. `routeHash()` returns the in-hash anchor (`#section`), so in-page anchor links keep working alongside hash routing.

### Links

Both forms work — pick whichever is easier in your code:

```html
<a href="/about">About</a>
<!-- plain path — preferred for shared code -->
<a href="#/about">About</a>
<!-- explicit hash form — also intercepted -->
```

`<RouterLink>` automatically renders the hash form (`<a href="#/about">`) in hash mode, so right-click → copy link gives a working URL.

In-page anchor links (`<a href="#section">`) are not intercepted — they behave as normal browser anchors. Only links beginning with `#/` (a slash after the hash) are treated as in-app navigations.

### What's not supported in hash mode

**SSR + hydration.** The hash is never sent to the server, so it cannot pre-render the active route. Calling `mount({ hydrate: true })` or `.hydrate(registry)` while in hash mode logs a warning. Use plain SPA mode for hash-mode apps:

```ts
setHistoryMode("hash");
pageRouter.mount("#app"); // ← no { hydrate: true }
```

You can still register loaders, but they run on the client (via the loader endpoint or by calling `runLoader()` yourself) — there is no server-rendered initial state.

**Per-router mode.** History mode is process-global, not per-builder. This is intentional: `navigate()`, `RouterLink`, and `prefetch()` are module-level and would otherwise need explicit instance threading. If your app needs both modes simultaneously, that's not a use case this router supports.

### Switching modes

`setHistoryMode()` can be called more than once, but listeners registered before a switch keep using their original adapter until the router is unmounted and remounted. In practice, set the mode once at app entry and leave it alone.

---

## Core API

### `router()`

Creates a new router instance and **resets the route registry**. Always call `router()` fresh — never share instances across server requests.

Returns a `RouterBuilder`.

---

#### `.route(pattern, island, loader?)`

Registers a route. Patterns are matched in **declaration order** — first match wins. Uses [rou3](https://github.com/h3js/rou3) for matching, the same engine as Nitro.

The optional `loader` is a data-fetching function that runs before the page renders. Its return value is passed as input props to the island. On the client, loaders are fetched via the `/__ilha/loader` endpoint on navigation.

```ts
import { loader } from "@ilha/router";

const userLoader = loader(async ({ params }) => {
  return { user: await fetchUser(params.id) };
});

router().route("/user/:id", userPage, userLoader).mount("#app");
```

| Pattern         | Matches             | `routeParams()`                   |
| --------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `/`             | `/`                 | `{}`                              |
| `/about`        | `/about`            | `{}`                              |
| `/user/:id`     | `/user/42`          | `{ id: "42" }`                    |
| `/:org/:repo`   | `/ilha/router`      | `{ org: "ilha", repo: "router" }` |
| `/docs/**:slug` | `/docs/guide/intro` | `{ slug: "guide/intro" }`         |
| `/**`           | anything            | `{}`                              |

> Static segments take priority over `:param` segments — `/user/me` will match before `/user/:id`.

Returns the same `RouterBuilder` for chaining.

---

#### `.mount(target, options?)` — browser only

Mounts the router into a DOM element or CSS selector. Sets up `popstate` listening and intercepts internal `<a>` clicks automatically.

```ts
const unmount = router().route("/", homePage).mount("#app");

// later:
unmount();
```

**Options:**

| Option     | Type                     | Default     | Description                                                |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hydrate`  | `boolean`                | `false`     | Preserve SSR DOM on first mount (no destructive re-render) |
| `registry` | `Record<string, Island>` | `undefined` | Island registry for interactive hydration on navigation    |

When `hydrate: true`, `.mount()` does **not** wipe existing SSR HTML. It instead mounts a hidden navigation handler that re-renders routes with hydration on subsequent navigations.

> Combining `hydrate: true` with hash mode logs a warning — hash routes are never visible to the server, so SSR can't pre-render them. Use plain SPA mode (no `hydrate`) for hash-mode apps.

No-op with a console warning when called outside a browser environment.

---

#### `.render(url)` — server / SSR

Resolves the given URL against the route registry and returns a synchronous HTML string. Accepts a path string, full URL string, or `URL` object. Populates all route signals identically to the browser.

```ts
const html = router().route("/", HomePage).route("/**", notFound).render("/");
// → '<div data-router-view><p>home</p></div>'
```

Renders `<div data-router-empty></div>` when no route matches.

---

#### `.renderHydratable(url, registry, options?, request?)` — server / SSR

Async variant of `.render()` that outputs HTML with `data-ilha` hydration markers so the client can rehydrate without a full re-render. If a loader is registered for the matched route, it runs first and its return value is serialized into `data-ilha-props`.

```ts
const html = await router().route("/", HomePage).renderHydratable("/", registry);
// → '<div data-router-view><div data-ilha="Home">…</div></div>'
```

If the active island is not found in the registry, falls back to plain SSR and emits a `console.warn`.

**Options** extend `HydratableOptions` from `ilha`:

| Option     | Type      | Default | Description                                           |
| ---------- | --------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `snapshot` | `boolean` | `true`  | Embed island state as `data-ilha-state` for hydration |

---

#### `.renderResponse(url, registry, options?, request?)` — server / SSR

Structured-envelope variant of `.renderHydratable()`. Returns a `RenderResponse` discriminated union instead of a raw HTML string, so the host server can emit proper HTTP status codes for redirects and loader errors.

```ts
const res = await router()
  .route("/protected", protectedPage, authLoader)
  .renderResponse("/protected", registry);

if (res.kind === "redirect") {
  return Response.redirect(res.to, res.status);
}
if (res.kind === "error") {
  return new Response(res.html, { status: res.status });
}
return new Response(res.html, { headers: { "content-type": "text/html" } });
```

| `kind`       | Fields                                              | When                                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `"html"`     | `html: string`, `status?: number`                   | Normal render; `status` is 404 if no match |
| `"redirect"` | `to: string`, `status: number`                      | Loader called `redirect()`                 |
| `"error"`    | `status: number`, `message: string`, `html: string` | Loader called `error()` or threw           |

---

#### `.runLoader(url, request?)` — server / SSR

Runs the loader chain for the matched route without rendering any HTML. Returns a discriminated union result. Used by the `/__ilha/loader` endpoint the Vite plugin exposes for client-side navigation.

```ts
const result = await router().route("/user/:id", userPage, userLoader).runLoader("/user/42");

if (result.kind === "data") {
  console.log(result.data); // → { user: { id: "42" } }
}
```

| `kind`        | Fields                              | When                             |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `"data"`      | `data: Record<string, unknown>`     | Loader succeeded (or no loader)  |
| `"redirect"`  | `to: string`, `status: number`      | Loader called `redirect()`       |
| `"error"`     | `status: number`, `message: string` | Loader called `error()` or threw |
| `"not-found"` | —                                   | No route matched the URL         |

---

#### `.prime()` — browser only

Primes route context signals from the current `window.location` **before** `ilha.mount()` runs. This prevents a signal mismatch that would destroy hydrated bindings.

Call this after all routes are registered and before mounting islands for interactivity:

```ts
import { mount } from "ilha";
import { pageRouter } from "ilha:pages";
import { registry } from "ilha:registry";

pageRouter.prime();              // ← sync signals first
mount(registry, { root: … });   // ← then hydrate islands
pageRouter.mount("#app", { hydrate: true, registry });
```

---

#### `.hydrate(registry, options?)` — browser only

Convenience method that combines `.prime()`, `ilha.mount()`, and `.mount()` into a single call. **This is the recommended client entry point.**

```ts
pageRouter.hydrate(registry);

// With options:
pageRouter.hydrate(registry, {
  root: document.getElementById("root"), // defaults to document.body
  target: "#app", // defaults to root
});
```

Returns an `unmount` function that tears down all listeners and hydrated islands.

> `.hydrate()` is for SSR + history-mode apps. In hash mode, use plain `.mount("#app")` instead — the server has no visibility into hash routes, so there's nothing to hydrate against.

---

#### `.attachLoader(pattern, loader)` — runtime

Attaches or replaces a loader on an already-registered route pattern. No-op if the pattern was never registered via `.route()`. Used by the `ilha:loaders` virtual module to wire server-only loaders onto the client-safe `pageRouter` at SSR time.

```ts
router().route("/user/:id", userPage).attachLoader("/user/:id", serverLoader);
```

---

### `setHistoryMode(mode)` · `getHistoryMode()`

Selects the history strategy used by the router. Defaults to `"history"` (HTML5 History API, reads/writes `location.pathname`). Set to `"hash"` to store the route in `location.hash` instead — see the [Hash mode](#hash-mode) section above for when to use it.

```ts
import { setHistoryMode, getHistoryMode } from "@ilha/router";

setHistoryMode("hash");
getHistoryMode(); // → "hash"
```

The mode is process-global. Call `setHistoryMode()` once at app entry, before any `.mount()`, `.hydrate()`, or `prime()` call.

---

### `navigate(to, options?)`

Programmatically navigate to a path. Updates the URL, history stack, and all reactive signals. Duplicate navigations (same URL) are no-ops.

```ts
import { navigate } from "@ilha/router";

navigate("/about");
navigate("/about", { replace: true }); // replaces instead of pushing
```

In hash mode, `navigate("/about")` writes `#/about` into `location.hash`. The argument is always the logical path — no need to prefix it with `#`.

No-op on the server.

---

### `prime()`

Standalone export of the same signal-priming function available as `.prime()` on the builder. Useful when managing the priming step separately from the router instance.

```ts
import { prime } from "@ilha/router";

prime();
```

---

### `loader(fn)`

Identity function for declaring a typed data loader. Exists as a type anchor and as a marker the Vite plugin uses to detect exported loaders automatically. The loader receives a `LoaderContext` and must return or resolve to a plain object (serializable to JSON for client-side fetches).

```ts
import { loader } from "@ilha/router";

export const load = loader(async ({ params, request, url, signal }) => {
  const user = await fetchUser(params.id, { signal });
  return { user };
});
```

Inside a loader, call `redirect()` or `error()` to short-circuit rendering:

```ts
import { loader, redirect, error } from "@ilha/router";

export const load = loader(async ({ params }) => {
  const session = await getSession();
  if (!session) redirect("/login", 302);
  const post = await getPost(params.id);
  if (!post) error(404, "Post not found");
  return { post };
});
```

Returns `fn` unchanged.

---

### `redirect(to, status?)`

Throws a `Redirect` sentinel that is caught by the loader execution pipeline. Always use inside a loader — do not catch it yourself.

```ts
import { redirect } from "@ilha/router";

redirect("/login"); // 302 by default
redirect("/moved", 301); // permanent redirect
```

---

### `error(status, message)`

Throws a `LoaderError` sentinel that is caught by the loader execution pipeline. The rendered output will be an inline error element; use `.renderResponse()` on the server to intercept loader errors before they reach the client.

```ts
import { error } from "@ilha/router";

error(404, "Not found");
error(403, "Forbidden");
```

---

### `composeLoaders(loaders)`

Merges multiple loaders into a single loader. All loaders run **concurrently** via `Promise.all`. Later loaders win on key collision — the page loader overrides a layout loader for the same key.

Used internally by the Vite plugin to compose layout loaders with the page loader. Also available for manual composition.

```ts
import { composeLoaders, loader } from "@ilha/router";

const layoutLoader = loader(async () => ({ user: await getCurrentUser() }));
const pageLoader = loader(async ({ params }) => ({ post: await getPost(params.id) }));

const combined = composeLoaders([layoutLoader, pageLoader]);
// → { user: …, post: … }
```

If any loader in the chain throws a `Redirect` or `LoaderError`, the composed loader re-throws it immediately.

---

### `prefetch(pathWithSearch)`

Prefetches the loader data for a given path by calling the `/__ilha/loader` endpoint in the background. The result is cached and consumed on the next navigation to that path, making the transition feel instant. Safe to call repeatedly — an in-flight request for the same path is reused until it resolves and is consumed, avoiding duplicate network requests.

```ts
import { prefetch } from "@ilha/router";

prefetch("/user/42");
prefetch("/dashboard?tab=overview");
```

No-op on the server, for paths with no registered loader, or for unmatched paths.

`RouterLink` automatically calls `prefetch()` on `mouseenter` for links that carry the `data-prefetch` attribute (set by default). You can opt a specific link out with `data-prefetch="false"`.

---

### `useRoute()`

Returns reactive signal accessors for the current route state. Safe to call inside any island render function on both client and server.

```ts
import { useRoute } from "@ilha/router";

const MyPage = ilha.render(() => {
  const { path, params, search, hash } = useRoute();
  return `<p>user id: ${params().id}</p>`;
});
```

---

### `routePath` · `routeParams` · `routeSearch` · `routeHash`

The underlying context signals — use these outside of islands when you need direct signal access.

```ts
import { routePath, routeParams, routeSearch, routeHash } from "@ilha/router";

routePath(); // → "/user/42"
routeParams(); // → { id: "42" }
routeSearch(); // → "?tab=docs"
routeHash(); // → "#section"
```

---

### `isActive(pattern)`

Returns `true` if the current path matches the given registered pattern. Uses O(1) reverse island lookup internally.

```ts
import { isActive } from "@ilha/router";

isActive("/about"); // → true / false
isActive("/user/:id"); // → true when on any /user/* path
```

---

### `enableLinkInterception(root?, options?)`

Attaches a delegated click listener to `root` (defaults to `document`) that intercepts `<a>` clicks and routes them client-side. Called automatically by `.mount()`.

Skips links that are external, `target="_blank"`, anchor-only (`#hash`), modified (`Ctrl`/`Meta`/`Shift`), or marked with `data-no-intercept`. Also skips events already handled (`e.defaultPrevented`).

Returns a cleanup function.

```ts
const stop = enableLinkInterception(myContainer, { prefetch: true });
stop(); // remove listener
```

**Options:**

| Option     | Type      | Default | Description                           |
| ---------- | --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `prefetch` | `boolean` | `true`  | Enable prefetch on `mouseenter` hover |

No-op on the server.

---

### `RouterView`

The outlet island rendered by `.mount()` and `.render()`. Wraps the active island in `<div data-router-view>`, or renders `<div data-router-empty></div>` when no route matches.

```ts
import { RouterView } from "@ilha/router";

RouterView.toString(); // SSR
RouterView.mount(el); // client
```

---

### `RouterLink`

A declarative link island that calls `navigate()` on click. Automatically prefetches loader data for the target path on `mouseenter` (opt out per-link with `data-prefetch="false"`).

```ts
import { RouterLink } from "@ilha/router";

RouterLink.toString({ href: "/about", label: "About" });
// → '<a data-link data-prefetch href="/about">About</a>'
```

---

### `wrapLayout(layout, page)`

Wraps a page island with a layout handler. Used internally by the Vite plugin codegen — also available for manual composition.

On client hydration, `wrapLayout` mounts the full layout island (layout child slots `p:*` and the keyed page slot `k:page`) from existing SSR DOM — it does not re-render layout markup from serialized props. Interactive components in `+layout.tsx` (state, event handlers, nested islands) hydrate the same way as the page.

```ts
import { wrapLayout } from "@ilha/router";

const wrapped = wrapLayout(myLayout, myPage);
```

---

### `defineLayout(fn)`

A typed helper that returns the layout function as-is. Use it instead of the `satisfies LayoutHandler` cast for a cleaner, import-light syntax.

```ts
// src/pages/+layout.ts
import { defineLayout } from "@ilha/router";
import ilha, { html } from "ilha";

export default defineLayout((children) =>
  ilha.render(
    () => html`
      <nav>
        <a href="/">Home</a>
        <a href="/about">About</a>
      </nav>
      <main>${children}</main>
    `,
  ),
);
```

Equivalent to annotating with `satisfies LayoutHandler` but requires no explicit type import.

---

### `wrapError(handler, page)`

Wraps a page island with an error boundary. If the page throws during SSR (`.toString()`) or on the client during `.mount()`, the `handler` receives the error and current route snapshot and returns a fallback island. The nearest (innermost) `wrapError` boundary catches first. If the inner handler re-throws, the next outer boundary takes over.

```ts
import { wrapError } from "@ilha/router";

const safe = wrapError(myErrorHandler, myPage);
```

> **Note:** Error boundaries wrap the _page island's render_, not the loader. Loader errors (thrown via `error()`) are surfaced through `.renderResponse()` — they do not currently route through `+error.ts` boundaries. Use `.renderResponse()` to handle loader errors at the HTTP layer.

---

## TypeScript Types

```ts
interface RouteSnapshot {
  path: string;
  params: Record<string, string>;
  search: string;
  hash: string;
}

interface AppError {
  message: string;
  status?: number;
  stack?: string;
}

interface LoaderContext {
  params: Record<string, string>;
  request: Request;
  url: URL;
  signal: AbortSignal;
}

type Loader<T> = (ctx: LoaderContext) => Promise<T> | T;

// Extract the return type of a loader
type InferLoader<L> = L extends Loader<infer T> ? Awaited<T> : never;

// Merge multiple loader return types — later loaders win on key collision
type MergeLoaders<Ls extends readonly Loader<any>[]> = /* … */;

type LayoutHandler = (children: Island) => Island;
type ErrorHandler = (error: AppError, route: RouteSnapshot) => Island;

type RenderResponse =
  | { kind: "html"; html: string; status?: number }
  | { kind: "redirect"; to: string; status: number }
  | { kind: "error"; status: number; message: string; html: string };

interface NavigateOptions {
  replace?: boolean;
}

interface MountOptions {
  hydrate?: boolean;
  registry?: Record<string, Island>;
}

interface HydrateOptions {
  root?: Element;
  target?: string | Element;
}

type HistoryMode = "history" | "hash";
type RouterMode = "spa" | "mpa";

interface RouterOptions {
  mode?: RouterMode; // default: "spa"
}

// Helper — returns fn as-is with LayoutHandler type enforced
function defineLayout(fn: LayoutHandler): LayoutHandler;

// Identity — type anchor and Vite plugin marker
function loader<T>(fn: Loader<T>): Loader<T>;

// Throws a Redirect sentinel — use inside loaders only
function redirect(to: string, status?: number): never;

// Throws a LoaderError sentinel — use inside loaders only
function error(status: number, message: string): never;

// Merges loaders — later loaders win on key collision
function composeLoaders<Ls extends readonly Loader<any>[]>(loaders: Ls): Loader<MergeLoaders<Ls>>;

// Selects the history strategy. Default: "history". Call before .mount() / .hydrate().
function setHistoryMode(mode: HistoryMode): void;
function getHistoryMode(): HistoryMode;
```

---

## File-system Routing

`@ilha/router` includes a Vite plugin that scans `src/pages/`, resolves layout and error boundary chains, and generates a ready-to-use router — no manual route registration needed.

### Setup

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { pages } from "@ilha/router/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [pages()],
});
```

Add `.ilha/` (or your custom `generated` path) to `.gitignore`.

### Directory structure

```
src/pages/
  +layout.ts              ← root layout (wraps all pages)
  +error.ts               ← root error boundary
  index.ts                → /
  about.ts                → /about
  (auth)/                 ← route group — transparent to the URL
    +layout.ts            ← layout scoped to (auth) pages only
    sign-in.ts            → /sign-in
    sign-up.ts            → /sign-up
  (marketing)/            ← another route group
    index.ts              → /
  user/
    +layout.ts            ← nested layout (wraps user/* only)
    +error.ts             ← nested error boundary
    [id].ts               → /user/:id
    [id]/
      settings.ts         → /user/:id/settings
  [...slug].ts            → /**:slug
```

### Filename → pattern mapping

| File                      | Pattern         |
| ------------------------- | --------------- |
| `index.ts`                | `/`             |
| `about.ts`                | `/about`        |
| `[id].ts`                 | `/:id`          |
| `user/[id].ts`            | `/user/:id`     |
| `[org]/[repo].ts`         | `/:org/:repo`   |
| `[...slug].ts`            | `/**:slug`      |
| `(auth)/sign-in.ts`       | `/sign-in`      |
| `(auth)/[token].ts`       | `/:token`       |
| `(shop)/products/[id].ts` | `/products/:id` |

`.test.ts`, `.spec.ts`, and `.d.ts` files are automatically excluded.

### Route groups

Folders wrapped in parentheses — `(name)` — are **route groups**. They organise files without contributing a segment to the URL. The group name is completely invisible to the router.

```
src/pages/
  (auth)/
    sign-in.ts    → /sign-in   ✓  (not /auth/sign-in)
    sign-up.ts    → /sign-up   ✓
  (marketing)/
    index.ts      → /          ✓
    pricing.ts    → /pricing   ✓
```

Route groups are useful for:

- **Shared layouts without a shared URL prefix** — place a `+layout.ts` inside `(auth)/` and it wraps only those pages, with no `/auth` prefix in the URL.
- **Organising large page trees** — split pages into logical sections (`(admin)`, `(public)`, `(shop)`) while keeping flat URLs.
- **Co-locating related pages** — keep sign-in, sign-up, and password reset together in `(auth)/` for clarity.

> Groups can be nested: `(a)/(b)/page.ts` → `/page`. Both group folders are transparent.

> If two files in different groups resolve to the **same pattern** (e.g. `(auth)/sign-in.ts` and `sign-in.ts` both produce `/sign-in`), the plugin warns about a duplicate pattern and the first match wins deterministically.

### Route sorting

Routes are sorted automatically by specificity — no need to order files manually:

1. **Static** paths (`/about`) — highest priority
2. **Parameterised** paths (`/user/:id`)
3. **Wildcard** paths (`/**:slug`) — lowest priority

Within the same tier, longer segment counts and alphabetical order act as tiebreakers for determinism. Route group pages sort alongside regular pages by their resolved pattern — the group folder is transparent.

### Layouts

A `+layout.ts` wraps every page in its directory and all subdirectories. Layouts compose **inside-out** — the nearest layout is innermost, the root layout is outermost.

```ts
// src/pages/+layout.ts
import { defineLayout } from "@ilha/router";
import ilha, { html } from "ilha";

export default defineLayout((children) =>
  ilha.render(
    () => html`
      <nav>
        <a href="/">Home</a>
        <a href="/about">About</a>
      </nav>
      <main>${children}</main>
    `,
  ),
);
```

Alternatively, using the explicit type annotation:

```ts
// src/pages/+layout.ts — using satisfies (equivalent)
import type { LayoutHandler } from "@ilha/router/vite";
import ilha, { html } from "ilha";

export default ((children) =>
  ilha.render(
    () => html`
      <nav>
        <a href="/">Home</a>
        <a href="/about">About</a>
      </nav>
      <main>${children}</main>
    `,
  )) satisfies LayoutHandler;
```

A `+layout.ts` inside a route group folder works exactly like a regular nested layout — it wraps only the pages inside that group, without affecting pages elsewhere.

```
src/pages/
  +layout.ts          ← wraps ALL pages (including those in groups)
  (auth)/
    +layout.ts        ← wraps (auth) pages only: /sign-in, /sign-up
    sign-in.ts
    sign-up.ts
  about.ts            ← wrapped by root layout only
```

### Page loaders

A page file can export a `load` function declared with the `loader()` helper. The Vite plugin automatically detects the named `load` export, composes it with any layout loaders in the chain (outermost first, then page), and wires them into the router via `.attachLoader()` at SSR time.

```ts
// src/pages/user/[id].ts
import { loader } from "@ilha/router";
import ilha from "ilha";

export const load = loader(async ({ params }) => {
  const user = await fetchUser(params.id);
  return { user };
});

export default ilha.input<{ user: User }>().render((input) => `<h1>${input.user.name}</h1>`);
```

The `load` export must be declared with the `loader()` helper so the Vite plugin can identify it via export name.

### Layout loaders

A `+layout.ts` can also export a loader. Layout loaders run concurrently with the page loader. The page loader wins on key collision.

```ts
// src/pages/+layout.ts
import { defineLayout, loader } from "@ilha/router";

export const load = loader(async () => {
  return { currentUser: await getCurrentUser() };
});

export default defineLayout((children) => /* … */);
```

Layout loaders are composed automatically — you do not need to call `composeLoaders()` manually.

### Error boundaries

A `+error.ts` catches any error thrown during rendering of pages in its directory and all subdirectories. The nearest boundary wins. If an inner boundary re-throws, the next outer boundary takes over.

```ts
// src/pages/+error.ts
import type { ErrorHandler } from "@ilha/router/vite";
import ilha from "ilha";

export default ((error, route) =>
  ilha.render(
    () => `
    <div class="error">
      <h1>${error.status ?? 500}</h1>
      <p>${error.message}</p>
      <p>Path: ${route.path}</p>
    </div>
  `,
  )) satisfies ErrorHandler;
```

### Virtual modules

The plugin exposes three virtual modules:

| Module          | Export       | Description                                  |
| --------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| `ilha:pages`    | `pageRouter` | A `RouterBuilder` with all routes registered |
| `ilha:registry` | `registry`   | `Record<string, Island>` for hydration       |
| `ilha:loaders`  | —            | Side-effect import that wires server loaders |

```ts
// routes/[...].ts — Nitro catch-all handler
import { pageRouter } from "ilha:pages";
import { registry } from "ilha:registry";
import "ilha:loaders"; // ← wire server loaders

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const html = await pageRouter.renderHydratable(event.node.req.url ?? "/", registry);
  return new Response(`<!doctype html><html><body>${html}</body></html>`, {
    headers: { "content-type": "text/html" },
  });
});
```

```ts
// src/client.ts — browser entry
import { pageRouter } from "ilha:pages";
import { registry } from "ilha:registry";

pageRouter.hydrate(registry);
```

### Plugin options

```ts
pages({
  dir: "src/pages", // pages directory (default: "src/pages")
  generated: ".ilha/routes.ts", // generated file output (default: ".ilha/routes.ts")
  mode: "spa", // "spa" | "mpa" (default: "spa")
});
```

Use `mode: "mpa"` when you want filesystem-routed pages to behave like a multi-page app: the current page can still be SSR-rendered and hydrated, but in-app links are not intercepted by the router, so navigation is handled by the browser as a full document request.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { pages } from "@ilha/router/vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [pages({ mode: "mpa" })],
});
```

The plugin regenerates the routes file only when content actually changes — avoiding unnecessary HMR invalidations. Structural changes (file add/remove, `+layout.ts`/`+error.ts` edits, or changes to loader exports) trigger full HMR reloads.

## SSR + Hydration

The same route config runs on both sides. Signals (`routePath`, `routeParams`, etc.) are populated identically by `.render()`/`.renderHydratable()` on the server and `.mount()`/`.hydrate()` on the client:

```ts
// server: resolves URL → hydratable HTML string
await pageRouter.renderHydratable("/user/42", registry);
routeParams(); // → { id: "42" }

// client: hydrates SSR DOM, sets up navigation
pageRouter.hydrate(registry);
navigate("/user/99");
routeParams(); // → { id: "99" }
```

### Full SSR → hydration flow

```
server                           client
──────────────────────────────   ───────────────────────────────────
renderHydratable(url, registry)  pageRouter.prime()        ← sync signals first
  → data-ilha="…" markers        mount(registry, { root }) ← hydrate islands
  → data-ilha-state snapshot     pageRouter.mount(target,  ← setup navigation
                                   { hydrate: true, registry })
```

Or use the one-liner: `pageRouter.hydrate(registry)`.

### Loader data flow

On the **server**, loaders run inside `.renderHydratable()` / `.renderResponse()`. Their return value is serialized into `data-ilha-props` on the island element so the client can rehydrate without re-fetching.

On the **client**, navigations fetch loader data from the `/__ilha/loader` endpoint before mounting the next island. The endpoint is served automatically by the Vite plugin (dev) and the Nitro adapter (production).

```
server                         client (navigation)
────────────────────────────   ─────────────────────────────────────
renderHydratable               GET /__ilha/loader?path=/user/42
  → executeLoader(…)             → runLoader("/user/42")
  → island.hydratable(props)     → fetchLoaderData("/user/42")
  → data-ilha-props="{…}"        → mountRouteWithHydration(island, host, …)
```
